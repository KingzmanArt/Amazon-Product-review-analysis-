## Dashboard Preview


## Observations and Insights

These insights are crafted for business stakeholders to inform pricing, inventory, and marketing strategies:

### ðŸ”¸ Discounts vs Rating:
- No direct correlation between higher discounts and better ratings.
- Categories with deep discounts (like Home Improvement) didnâ€™t always translate to higher ratings.

### ðŸ”¸ Review Engagement:
- Electronics and Computers received the **highest review volume**, indicating higher user engagement and visibility.
- Many products had fewer than 1,000 reviews, signaling low exposure or new listings.
- Products with both high ratings and review volume are best-sellers

### ðŸ”¸ Product Count:
- Most products fall within the **<â‚¹200** price range, showing a preference or saturation in budget products.

### ðŸ”¸ Revenue Potential:
- Top 3 revenue-contributing categories: **Electronics**, **Computers & Accessories**, and **Home & Kitchen**.
- These should be prioritized for marketing and stock optimization.

### ðŸ”¸ Top Products:
- Top 5 products by engagement (rating Ã— reviews) include USB Cables and Smart TVs.
- These products have both **high popularity and quality**, making them good promotional anchors.

### ðŸ”¸ Rating Distribution
- Over **1,100 products** have ratings in the **4.0â€“5.0** range, indicating generally high satisfaction.
- Very few products rated below 2.0 â€” possibly filtered during listing.

### ðŸ”¸ Review Count Distribution
- Majority of products have **fewer than 1,000 reviews**.
- Electronics and Computers dominate total review volume, signaling strong visibility and buyer trust.


## Recommendations

1. **Focus marketing spend** on top-performing categories (Electronics, Computers).
2. **Reduce discounts** on low-engagement categories unless they impact sales volume.
3. **Encourage review activity** on under-reviewed products via follow-up emails or incentives.
4. **Consider price repositioning** for products in oversaturated low-price segments.
5. **Use high-rated products** as anchors or featured listings in promotional banners.

## Limitations

- **Review content was not analyzed semantically** (e.g., positive vs negative sentiment).
- **Data represents a static snapshot**, not real-time or time-series trends.
- **External factors** like brand popularity, availability, and delivery time were not considered.
- **Potential revenue** is estimated and doesnâ€™t account for returns, taxes, or conversion rates.
